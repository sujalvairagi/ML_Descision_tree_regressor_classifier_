the following are the 2 projects made by me to have a clear understanding of descision tree model

1. Decision Tree Classifier – Heart Disease Prediction
Built a decision tree classifier to predict heart disease presence using medical attributes. Tuned hyperparameters and visualized the optimized tree for interpretability.

2. Decision Tree Regressor – California Housing Price Prediction
Used a decision tree regressor to predict median house values in California. Applied EDA, correlation analysis, and GridSearchCV for model optimization.
